# Redux To-Do Application

## Description

This is a responsive to-do list application built with React and Redux Toolkit. It includes features such as adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks. The app also integrates Bootstrap for modals and user-friendly styling. It is a modern web application that demonstrates scalable state management and reusable components.

## Purpose

The app demonstrates how to:

-   Implement state management using Redux Toolkit with slices for modular and maintainable code.
-   Create dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React and Bootstrap.
-   Utilize modals for editing and providing user feedback.
-   Handle real-time state updates with Redux actions and reducers.

## Key Features

-   **Task Management:** Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks with a responsive UI.
-   **State Management:** Centralized state using Redux Toolkit with separate slices for tasks and counters.
-   **Dynamic Modals:** Includes warning, info, and edit modals using Bootstrap for a polished user experience.
-   **Real-Time Updates:** Task list and counters update in real time as actions are performed.
-   **Responsive Design:** Designed for desktop and mobile, with a clean interface.

## Why This Project Stands Out

-   **Advanced State Management:** Demonstrates the power of Redux Toolkit for organizing and maintaining application state.
-   **Component Reusability:** Features modular components like `MyModal`, `WarningModal`, and `InfoModal`, which can be reused across projects.
-   **Clean Design:** Combines React and Bootstrap for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
-   **Learning Tool:** A great example for understanding Redux and React integration with modern tools.
