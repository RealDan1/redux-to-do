# To-Do List Application

## Description

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List web application built with React, Redux, and React-Bootstrap. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding, editing, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them. The application uses Bootstrap for a modern, responsive UI, making the interface clean and user-friendly.

## Purpose

The app demonstrates how to:

-   Manage state using Redux for efficient task management.
-   Implement React-Bootstrap modals for better UI/UX interactions.
-   Utilize React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and UI updates.
-   Dispatch Redux actions to update the global store.

## Key Features

-   **Task Management:** Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
-   **Bootstrap modals for Interaction:**
    -   **Instruction Modal:** Guides users on how to use the app.
    -   **Edit Modal:** Allows users to update existing tasks.
    -   **Warning Modal:** Displays important alerts.
-   **Redux Integration:** Uses Redux for centralized state management.
-   **Bootstrap UI:** Styled with React-Bootstrap for a clean, responsive design.
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
